class SendQueue:
    """ Implements a send_q replacement that uses threaded sends

    The default send_q is a deque that is filled in a read_cameras forever loop
    in the imagenode.py main() event loop. When the default send_q tests True
    because it contains images to send, the send_frame loop empties the send_q.
    It works, but has speed issues when sending occurs while motion detection is
    actively occuring at the same time.

    This class creates a drop-in replacement for send_q. This replacement
    send_q will always return len(send_q) as 0 as if empty, so that the main()
    event loop will loop forever in node.read_cameras() without ever sending
    anything. This is implemented by providing _bool_ and __len__ methods to
    prevent read_cameras from ever reaching the send_frame portion of the main
    imagenode.py event loop.

    This send_q replacement append() method will operate in read_cameras just as
    the deque did, but has a send_messages_forever method in a separate
    thread to send (message, image tuples) to empty the send_q. This
    implementation of send_q allows the imagenode.py main program to remain
    unchanged when send_threading is not set to True in the yaml settings.

    Parameters:
        maxlen (int): maximum length of send_q deque

    which line below caused the error. Fix the YAML file and rerun the
